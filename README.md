Personalized Aurora I plan to use on my ThinkPad.

Based on Aurora stable

In order to use this you have to:
- Install Aurora or Bazzite KDE

then run this command: ```sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/badwolf292/thinkos```


The current extra packages I have added are:
- rclone
- android-tools (adb)
- nmap
- tmux
- jotta-cli (CLI tool for Jottacloud)
